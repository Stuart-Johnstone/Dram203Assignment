									<h2>My Story in 5 Sentences.</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Currently I am now pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Calgary. From a young age I have had a mild interest in science and programming, and later I decided that I wanted to be a programmer. Getting into this program wasn’t easy and involved confronting many difficult road blocks. But working hard throughout my time in school has allowed me the opportunity to pursue my passion of programming. Because of my addiction to the subject I have ingrained myself in the local community, helping it grow and become more diverse. </p>

									<h2>My Story in 5 Paragraphs.</h2>
								</header>
								<p>This is the story of my adventure through education, and how I learned to love what I used to hate. This story will focus on three key time periods in my life, middle school, high school, and University. Middle School became the place where I developed my interests as a student. High School was the place where I learned how to push my limits. And my unfinished journey through University is where I have started to finally break out of my comfort zone. </p>
								<p>At the time, the step toward Middle School seemed like a massive one. Gaining the freedom to choose two options per semester and, if the teacher was feeling adventurous, the ability to choose where to sit in a classroom. These two freedoms ended up influencing my life more than I would have expected. The first freedom allowed me to take two classes that would prove vital to me later on, that being woodworking and robotics. The second allowed me to expand my shell beyond the small circle I had in elementary. The friends I made from this change were serious about learning and provided me with a different approach to school. They taught me that it was ok to ask for help and allowed me to catch up where I would normally feel lost. This sparked a great change, I started to enjoy learning for the first time. I started to excel in both math and science due to their analytical nature. Giving me a new long term goal to work towards, Engineering.</p>
								<p>Highschool brought along its own challenges, my newfound goal didn’t make them any easier. The first two years went by without a hitch smoothly, though something seemed to change toward the end. I found myself getting bored with the sciences that I have loved. This change of heart caused a last minute major change to Computer Science, chosen because of my growing love for the topic. This program should in theory be easier to get into. I irreversibly changed my schedule to 100% focus on getting into my new program, in the process locking me out of my other options. It would seem like removing all safety nets was a bad idea, but it shouldn’t have been a problem. The previous year’s competitive average was well below mine, there was no way I wouldn’t get in. For Christmas all I got was shattered hopes and dreams, the current competitive average was a full 10% higher than mine. After running some calculations, the only way I could meet that average was by getting 100% in my final two classes. My final semester became my proving ground and the level of sustained focus has been unmatched since. The hundreds of hours of hand sanding and late nights coding were ultimately rewarded in August. 15 days before the start of the University Semester I had almost lost hope, but I woke up one day to see a magical letter from the University. I'm in.</p>
								<p>Compared to my dramatic end to highschool, starting out in university seemed easy. I had already learned most of the material in my introductory classes, and the feeling of challenge had changed. I started coasting, and was being rewarded for it. Knowing that this feeling of invincibility was going to get myself into trouble, I started to seek a different challenge. It was convenient that around this time the computer science undergraduate society was hiring executives for their club. I applied to become the VP of Non-Academic Events liking the idea of running fun social events. After an interview I got invited to be a part of the team. There was one problem, it was to be the VP of External Relations. CSUS differs from other social clubs as we run one of the largest Hackathons in the country. I was now responsible for maintaining relationships with all of the club's sponsors and partners. On my first day as an executive I had been dragged to my first meeting with the primary sponsor of CalgaryHacks. After the meeting I felt wildly out of my depth, but excited. I knew that this feeling would drive me to become better at my job, and I wasn’t wrong. As I became more fromillier with the event we were organizing, I have also become more comfortable leading meetings and developing quality outreach plans. After two years in this position and two successful events, I am grateful for my spontaneous application. Without it I would be missing out on countless experiences and many new connections with both other students and industry professionals.</p>
								<p>The role of my education in my life has affected way more than just my professional trajectory. The schools I have attended have developed my drive for success and formed new connections that have made the effort worth it. My experience in middle school directly got me on the right path. High School proved to me what I can accomplish in tough situations. And University has challenged me for no better reason than self improvement.</p>

									<h2>My Motivation.</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I consider myself to be competitive with everything (aside from school). I am easily motivated by wanting to hit a higher number or gain a move up a level. At the moment I find myself really enjoying trying to push my limits when I’m biking. Whether that be trying to go faster on a downhill mountain trail or hold a higher average speed on the road. I’m addicted to the pursuit of being “good”. From what I have learned with my time working, there is a wall with “work”. You will get to a plateau and there isn’t anything you can do about it. This is why I’m so heavily focused on hobbies, if you start to plateau you can just find a new one. I decided pretty early on I work to live, not the other way around. </p>

									<h2>My Plan.</h2>
								</header>
								<p>At this point my goal is to graduate university and to get a decent job within a few months of graduation. This achievable goal will put me on track to live comfortably and pursue my hobbies. Graduating should not be difficult because at the point I'm at in my degree it should just be a matter of putting in the effort to finish my remaining classes. Getting a job post graduation will be made easier if I can get into an internship program as it is common to get re-hired post grad. Getting an internship requires having the right connections. Fortunately with my position as VP of External Communication, I have developed around a dozen connections with recruiters at different companies. This contact network will allow me to leverage my position when I am fighting with the rest of my class for the handful of available internships. Aside from interning, it will be important to continue developing my programming skills outside of school and work. This is because there is always a new version of a tool or a new language that will keep me in my discipline.								</p>
